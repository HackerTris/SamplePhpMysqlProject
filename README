This project contains php code which creates a simple social networking site. The code is based on the project described in "Learning PHP, MySQL, Javascript and CSS, A Step by Step Guid", by Robin Nixon.  I made some changes to it to enhance my learning process.

The code used in this project should NOT be copied; it is really just for my ownpersonal use.  I intend to keep this project in a repository so I can use it as a sort of template project in the future.
